{"title":"Climate Change in Developing World","markdown":{"yaml":{"bibliography":"references.bib"},"headingText":"Climate Change in Developing World","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-Chapter1","classes":[],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\nBecause much of the developing world lies between the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, earth's warmest latitudes, these parts will have to face the roughest weather changes as tropical climates are expected to experience the most intense temperature increase [@arnellGlobalRegionalImpacts2019] and temperature variation as a result of decreased soil moisture [@bathianyClimateModelsPredict2018]. This is further multiplied for these developing countries due to their lack of technological protection from heat, either because they are unavailable or unaffordable. As a result, these nations bear the burden of uncomfortable and dangerous temperatures more directly than wealthier and more temperate locales. As such, examining the effect of the increased temperature is especially salient for developing countries.\n\n# Temperature and Human Behavior\n\nThe association between temperature and aggression has been noted and studied thoroughly [@craigRelationshipTemperatureAggression2016]. The General Aggression Model and Routine Activity Theory are the predominant theories explaining this relationship [@vanlangeAggressionViolenceWorld2017]. The General Aggression Model outlines two categories of determinants of aggression. These include the individuals' personal and situational variables. Personal variables are individual-level predictors such as genetic dispositions, sex, and personal attitudes about violence. Situational variables include alcohol consumption, cultural influence regarding the permissibility of violence, and environmental factors like temperature.\n\nThe theory is that high temperature directly contributes to a higher propensity for violence. High temperatures may cause an increase in aggressive motivation, which under certain circumstances can manifest in the behavior of the same kind [@craigRelationshipTemperatureAggression2016]. Researchers analyzing data from Major League Baseball games found that higher temperatures increased the probability of an HTP event (where the batter is Hit by The Pitch) [@larrickTemperTemperatureTemptation2011]. This action could suggest that higher temperature increases the likelihood of retaliatory actions. Furthermore, an analysis of NFL (National Football League) data revealed a similar result, where the temperature had a positive relationship with aggressive penalties, such as unnecessary roughness [@craigRelationshipTemperatureAggression2016]. Such effects are especially pronounced in correctional facilities as high temperatures increase daily violent interactions by 20% and the probability of any violence by 18%, according to a study in Mississippi [@mukherjeeCausalEffectHeat2021].\n\nThe second theory connecting temperature and aggression, Routine Activity Theory, posits a more indirect effect. Under this theory, warmer temperatures increase the general activity level of the population, increasing all types of violent and nonviolent interactions [@sutherlandPrinciplesCriminology1992b]. Since some proportion of interactions results in conflict, an increase in all kinds of interactions also increases violent interactions. For example, during the winter, in temperate climates, much of the time is spent indoors at home. As a result, fewer individuals are out in public, and fewer people cross paths. A review of the studies concludes that temperature fluctuations and climate change might increase crime rates [@chersichViolenceHotWeather2019]. Most of the studies find some positive effect of the increased temperature on assaults and crimes in general [@bushmanCurveRelatingTemperature2005][@williamsRelationshipTemperatureAssault2015][@sommerComparingApplesApples2018], but not homicide [@trujilloEffectWeatherCrime2021]. Interestingly some studies find that at high temperatures (90 F), the relationship reverses, possibly because it becomes so hot people seek shelter in cool spaces [@gambleTemperatureViolentCrime2012]. Nonetheless, a review of the data of 15 US cities has not found significant correlations between temperature from climate change and crime rates [@lynchClimateChangeTemperatureCrimeHypothesis2022]. Most of the studies are conducted on municipalities or wealthy countries (such as New Zealand, the USA, and Australia), which might question generalizability. Mechanisms behind such temperature effects are unclear potential causes might be economic instability, migration, and conflicts within and between groups [@miles-noveloClimateChangePsychology2019].\n\nA different theoretical finding led by experimental psychologists proposes that warmth-primes-prosociality. The theory is based on the research of Williams and Bargh (2008) [@williamsExperiencingPhysicalWarmth2008], who found that people who briefly interacted with a warm object were more likely to act prosocially toward others. This is because physical warmth is thought to unconsciously activate concepts associated with interpersonal warmth, leading people to act more prosocially. This theory has been supported by subsequent studies showing a link between higher temperature, positive affect, and prosocial behaviors. For example, studies have found that participants handling a warm object are more likely to show trust, cooperate with others, and act prosocially in general compared to those holding a cold object[@storeyEffectsTemperaturePriming2013]. However, more recent studies failed to replicate the effects [@barghDoesPhysicalWarmth2019][@lynottEffectHapticAmbient2017].\n\nTo sum up, a recent meta-analysis of temperature-behavior-links studies finds no statistically significant effect of temperature on aggression or prosociality [@lynottEffectsTemperatureProsocial2023a]. Moreover, the research concludes that the results support the lack of such a relationship and speculates that the reported outcomes result from p-hacking or faulty causal modeling. While there might be a connection between temperature and human behavior, it is likely mediated through something else.\n\n## Temperature and Productivity\n\nLet us examine the labor supply decision of an individual whose work is not climate controlled, a common situation for most of the developing world. This worker chooses between supplying their labor for a wage or enjoying free time to pursue leisure. As temperature increases, the disutility of supplying labor relative to the utility of leisure is increased, which should result in the agent choosing less labor and more leisure. If this decision happens at scale, it will correspond to a contraction in labor supply and a reduction in output.\n\nThis result has been observed in microdata from Indian manufacturing firms, which estimated reduced productivity and absenteeism on hot days [@somanathanImpactTemperatureProductivity2021]. This study lends credence to the theory that excess temperature not only reduces willingness to work but also suggests that even when work is supplied, the quality and quantity suffer. This argument is further supported by a study conducted on office workers in which they found that for every degree above 89 degrees Fahrenheit, productivity decreased by approximately 2% [@seppanenEffectTemperatureTask2006]. For those in developing nations, the mechanism at work may be less important than its consequence. What is salient is that an increase in temperature could further reduce economic activity in countries that already struggle to compete.\n\nMost studies look at low-skilled workers' productivity as the most affected by the temperature, and their productivity is easier to measure. A recent study examined professional decision makers (US immigration judges) who have access to climate control and found that hotter temperatures decrease the likelihood of favorable decisions for US immigration court cases, with a 10째F increase reducing such decisions by 6.55% [@heyesTemperatureDecisionsEvidence2019]. This finding prompts other researchers to examine other effects of temperature on cognitive work besides productivity.\n\nAs firms look to maximize employees' productivity, the temperature is seen as an influential factor. Modern offices are built with climate control to help maintain optimal temperatures throughout the building. For a person not familiar with the effects of temperature on employee productivity, the million-dollar investments might seem excessive. A recent systematic review of the connection between \"Thermal Comfort and Productivity in Building\" concluded that the ideal temperature for productivity is around 22-24 째C, and temperatures above 24-26 째C and below 20 째C hinder performance. However, the effects of temperature are highly subjective, task and context-specific [@buenoEvaluatingConnectionThermal2021].\n\nSeveral recent papers examined the effects of industrial production in connection to temperature changes. Higher summer temperatures significantly negatively impact China's industrial output, though the result is less pronounced in warmer regions, possibly because of previous adaptations [@chenTemperatureIndustrialOutput2019]. Studies conducted in the USA [@isenRelationshipSeasonBirth2017] and Equador [@fishmanLongtermImpactsExposure2019] find that above-average in-utero temperature can lead to reduced education and lower earning for adults 30 years later. However, the effects seem to be mitigated by air conditioning availability for mothers.\n\n## Temperature and Mental Function\n\nUncomfortable temperature affects not only the body but also the mind. The excessive temperature has been associated with two concerning results: cognitive impairment and risk-seeking behavior. Excessively high temperature is unpleasant and distracting, and it also stresses the body. When the body is excessively hot, it spends a lot of its resources maintaining homeostasis [@rochaisHowDoesCognitive2019]. This depletes glucose levels which can lead to lower cognitive abilities. High temperatures stress the body, consuming glucose in the brain and negatively affecting cognition [@cedenolaurentReducedCognitiveFunction2018].\n\n[@wangBrainTemperatureIts2014]Although the brain comprises only 2% of the body's mass, it utilizes 25% of glucose and 20% of oxygen [@squireFundamentalNeuroscience2012]. It is a metabolically demanding organ that produces heat \\[howarthUpdatedEnergyBudgets2012\\] and is sensitive to temperature fluctuations [@kiyatkinBrainTemperatureFluctuation2002]. The brain's thermal regulatory capacity may affect its anatomical and physiological structure, influencing its processing capacity due to its temperature-dependent energy expenditure efficiency [@yuWarmBodyTemperature2012].\n\nA study of United States Naval officers found that hot and moist environments significantly degraded their performance in morse decoding [@mackworthEffectsHeatWireless1946]. Results such as these were not limited to the lab. In a study using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) combined with random weather fluctuations, researchers found evidence for decreases in cognitive performance in the short run on math tests when temperatures exceeded 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit [@graffzivinTemperatureHumanCapital2018]. Other studies have found that temperature can have a significant impact on high-stakes cognitive performance on tests according to studies from the USA [@parkTemperatureTestScores2016], China[@graffzivinTemperatureHighstakesCognitive2020], India [@gargTemperatureHumanCapital2020], potentially affecting equitable access to higher education.\n\nIt is not inconceivable that the long-run effect of increased temperature may not be mitigated in the developing world. During this study, strategies for coping with excessive heat available in the United States may only be possible in some developing countries. While a school in the United States could install an air conditioning system, this option is expensive and likely unavailable to schools in developing nations. As a result, long-term negative cognitive consequences could still be felt in developing countries. In addition to reductions in cognition, there is some evidence that increased temperature can lead to more risk-seeking behaviors.\n\nLaboratory experiments have shown that individuals trend towards high-risk and high-yield options when ambient temperatures are higher [@wangEmpiricalStudyImpacts2017]. Another research suggests that higher temperatures harm decision-making and risk-taking abilities by draining mental resources, reducing the prevalence of gambling (lotteries), and especially complex gambling [@cheemaInfluenceWarmCool2012]. While taking risks may not always be negative, these two taken in conjunction could be worrisome. After all, high-risk behavior, which may coincide with a reduction in cognitive abilities (if temperature causes both a decrease in cognition and an increase in risk-seeking behavior), is doubtful to produce positive results.\n\nThe effects of climate change go far beyond temperature as these global processes increase the frequency of catastrophic events such as tornados, earthquakes, draughts, and floods. We are not looking at these consequences of temperature change.\n\nOne of the effects of temperature is the exacerbation of mental illnesses. High temperatures associated with climate change may increase the risk of heat stroke and death among individuals taking certain psychotropic medications and may also negatively impact the mental health of vulnerable populations such as the elderly, youth, Indigenous peoples, and those living in low- and middle-income countries. The literature review [@charlsonClimateChangeMental2021] found a significant positive association between high temperatures and various mental health outcomes, including distress, hospital admissions for mental and neurological disorders, mortality attributed to mental and behavioral disorders, self-harm, and suicide rates. The susceptibility to these outcomes varies based on demographic variables such as age and type of disorder. While studies attempting to quantify the burden of mental disorders attributable to climate change are sparse, the available evidence suggests that the burden of disease related to climate change for mental disorders is not insignificant.\n\nOn the one hand, the available research paints a fairly bleak picture. The direct effect of temperature rise on individuals in the developing world could be extremely detrimental for equatorial developing nations. While some countries in the colder regions might welcome these increased temperatures (though the losses still outweigh the benefits), the evidence suggests excess heat may increase the propensity for violence, decrease productivity, and impair cognition. On the other hand, the results of the studies do not seem to be reliable and likely temperature effects can be negated with adaptation.\n\nWhile, for many, the ultimate results of increased temperature will undoubtedly be more important than the causal mechanisms at play, understanding these mechanisms could offer insight into how humanity might address this problem.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"code-overflow":"wrap","engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","thesis":{"supervisor":{"name":"Alessandra Cassar","url":"https://quarto.org/"},"degree-name":"Masters of Science Degree","university":"University of San Francisco","department":"Department of Economics","program":"International Development Economics","frontpage":"Frontmatter/frontpage.tex","toc":"Frontmatter/toc.tex"},"bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"quarto-thesis-pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"code-overflow":"wrap","engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":false,"toc-depth":2,"include-before-body":["partials/definitions.tex"],"include-in-header":["_extensions/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis/partials/in-header.tex"],"filters":[],"output-file":"index.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"documentclass":"book","classoption":["letterpaper","12pt","titlepage","oneside","final"],"template-partials":["_extensions/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis/partials/title.tex","_extensions/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis/partials/before-body.tex"],"colorlinks":false,"citecolor":"black","linkcolor":"black","urlcolor":"red","toclinkcolor":"black","thesis":{"supervisor":{"name":"Alessandra Cassar","url":"https://quarto.org/"},"degree-name":"Masters of Science Degree","university":"University of San Francisco","department":"Department of Economics","program":"International Development Economics","frontpage":"Frontmatter/frontpage.tex","toc":"Frontmatter/toc.tex"},"bibliography":["references.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
